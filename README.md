### Hi there 🌈 I'm Martina
I am an NLP scientist currently based in Venice, Italy 🍕. I started working as a data scientist in 2020 and almost immediately became passionate about the world of Natural Language Processing. In my previous life I studied statistics and its applications to particle physics and biology.
Every now and then I enjoy contributing to some competitions on Kaggle.

Things I'm interested in:

- 🧠 Artificial Intelligence
- 👩‍💻 Natural Language Processing
- 🍝 Food
- 🔭 At a high level: cosmology/biology/anything that has to do with scientific progress
